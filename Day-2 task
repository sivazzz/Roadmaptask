1.  Write a  blog on the Difference between document & window objects.

1. Document :-

//   It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
//   The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and DOM (Document object model)
//   It si loaded inside the window.
//   It is the object of window property.
//   All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
//   We can access the documennt from a window using the window.document
//   Properties of document objects such as title, body, cokies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window like this window.document.title
//   Syntax: document.propertyname;
//   example: document.line:  will return the title of the document


2. Window :-

//  It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.
//  The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
//  It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
//  It is the object of the browser.
//  Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
//  We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
//  Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
//  syntax:  window.propertyname;
//  example: window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
