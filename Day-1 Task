1. Write a blog on  Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2


HTTP/1.1 
// it works on the textual format.
// It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
// It compresses data by itself.
// There is head of line blocking that blocks all the request behind it untill it does not get its all resources.


HTTP/2
// It Works on the binary protocol.
// It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
// It uses HPACK for data compression.
// It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.


   2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representatioin in Javascript

   //     These objects are quite different from JavaScripts primitive data types.
   //     Data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol).
   //     In the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each ( depending on their types).
   //    Objects, in JavaScript, is its most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
